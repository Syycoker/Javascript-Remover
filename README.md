# Javascript-Remover
<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

TLDR : Failed an interview question, re-did it in my own time, made interview question into a working GUI Application.

Paste the HTML Tag in the texbox and click "Remove JavaScript", you can also copy the result into your clipboard with the "Copy" button.

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
There is an executable JAR File that you csn just open and test out and there are two classes that make the whole thing work.
The Main class where the GUI magic appears and JavaScript Remover which is the class that has the algorithm to remove the script tags and everything in-between.
